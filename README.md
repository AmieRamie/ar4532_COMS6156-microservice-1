__Note:__
- The default behavior for virtual environment creation is to
create the venv in the current folder/project.
- You can create the venv anywhere on the file system.
- You do not want to venv pushed to GitHub. So, if the venv is inside the
project, remove the directory from the set of files that will be pushed.
The easiest way is to add to a [.gitignore file.](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore)
