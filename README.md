2. Copy the code from this example into the directory for the project.<br><br>
3. Follow the steps for:
   1. Creating a virtual environment for your version of the project.
   2. ```pip``` installing ```requirements.txt```
   3. Executing and accessing the application.

Replace my uni with yours.
5. Rerun the application to test.


### Publish


<hr>

__Note:__
- The default behavior for virtual environment creation is to
create the venv in the current folder/project.
- You can create the venv anywhere on the file system.
- You do not want to venv pushed to GitHub. So, if the venv is inside the
project, remove the directory from the set of files that will be pushed.
The easiest way is to add to a [.gitignore file.](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore)

- Commit and push your application to the GitHub repository.
